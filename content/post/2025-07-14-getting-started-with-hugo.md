[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It's written in Go and known for its amazing speed and flexibility. In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Hugo and why I chose it for my blog.

## Why Choose a Static Site Generator?

Static site generators offer several advantages over traditional content management systems:

1. **Speed**: Static sites are incredibly fast since they don't require server-side processing or database queries.
2. **Security**: With no database or server-side scripts, there are fewer vulnerabilities to exploit.
3. **Simplicity**: The build process is straightforward, and the resulting site is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
4. **Version Control**: All content can be stored in a Git repository, making it easy to track changes and collaborate.
5. **Hosting Options**: Static sites can be hosted almost anywhere, often for free (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Getting Started with Hugo

### Installation

Installing Hugo is straightforward. On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

For other operating systems, check the [official installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

### Creating a New Site

Once Hugo is installed, you can create a new site with:

```bash
hugo new site mysite
```

This creates a new directory with the basic structure for your Hugo site.

### Choosing a Theme

Hugo has a wide variety of themes available. You can browse them at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/). For this blog, I chose the Clean White theme because of its clean design and readability.

To add a theme, you can use Git submodules:

```bash
cd mysite
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/themename/hugo-theme-name.git themes/hugo-theme-name
```

Then, update your `hugo.toml` (or `config.toml`) to use the theme:

```toml
theme = "hugo-theme-name"
```

### Creating Content

Hugo makes it easy to create new content. For example, to create a new blog post:

```bash
hugo new post/my-first-post.md
```

This creates a new Markdown file with front matter (metadata) already set up.

### Building and Previewing Your Site

To preview your site locally:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

This starts a local server with live reloading. The `-D` flag includes draft content.

To build your site for production:

```bash
hugo
```

This generates your static site in the `public` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Conclusion

Hugo is a powerful and flexible static site generator that makes it easy to create fast, secure websites. Whether you're building a personal blog, a documentation site, or a portfolio, Hugo provides the tools you need to succeed.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into Hugo's features and share tips for customizing your site. Stay tuned!
